        I'm sorry for being very depressing<br>
        I have many feelings that I've been supressing,<br>
		
		
		Before I met you there wasn't a lot of pressure on me, but when you said that I was your only real friend with everything that had been going on, and for some reason I felt like I had to do a lot more to keep you happy, and then devon asked me a few days after valentines to keep you happy and make you feel like you worth the world, those 2 things put a lot of pressure on me, not knowing that all I had to do was just be the person you first met, the happy go lucky me, so I tried to be myself but on a whole nother level and it ruined me mentally, trying to keep my feelings in so I don't lose you and trying to keep you happy 
        -->

		I don't know what you want me to say but if it means anything to you anymore, I still want you as a friend, I do still care for you despite how much it seems otherwise, as you know already your one of the only people that I've been that close too, one of the only people I could call a true friend, one of the only people I've loved that much, I know that I have hurt you multiple times and for that I am truely sorry, I'm sorry that I've been a real shitty friend, and person in general, I'm not good at controlling my emotions especially when they are towards one of my closest friends and it's because I'm too afraid to lose that friend, we both didn't wanna tell eachother how we felt because we didn't want to lose eachother and even tho I know that I my dumbass still let it happen, main reason for that is I didn't know how to control the emotions and thoughts I was having to the point I had to get my dad involved and I've never let him get involved in my emotional/mental state, he told me to message you a while ago but I didn't because I was scared that I would say something bad and hurt you even more then what I already have, I'm not good at words as you know, I know I don't really think before I speak, and the main reason for that is that I always over think everything, and I just kept on thinking "I'm going to say something retarded and just hurt you even more."
		<br>
		I'm just scared that I'll just end up hurting you in some other way, and me taking time was just me trying to figure out what I'm going to do to be a better person for you, learn how to control my feelings, learn how to be the person you wanted to be around again.
